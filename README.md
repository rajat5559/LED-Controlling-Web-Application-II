# LED-Controlling-Web-Application-II
Created a web application that can control three LEDs from internet using ThingSpeak cloud server and two ESP8266 (a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and micro- controller capabilities). By this method we can control different LEDs over internet using ThingSpeak IoT server & Web Application, and can view the logged data and graph over time on the ThingSpeak dashboard. ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP protocol over the internet or via a Local Area Network. ThingSpeak enables the creation of sensor logging applications, location tracking applications, and a social network of things with status update.

One of these two ESP8266 acts as a local server and creates its hotspot. This ESP8266 reads the LEDâ€™s state from channel of ThingSpeak server by connecting through WiFi router. It will send this data to another ESP8266(client) which will be connected to the hotspot of this ESP8266 (local server) in local network. Then ESP8266 (client) will control LEDs according to the commands given by user. To take the command from user and write the data on the ThingSpeak channel, we have created a web page having button to control the LEDs.
